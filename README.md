# CS271 Portfolio Project
This is my portfolio project for CS271 - Computer Architecture and Assembly Language.

## Overview
This program uses MASM x86 assembly language to write low level I/O procedures and Macros.

The program asks the user for 10 signed integers, validates the character input, converts the input to an array of integers, calculates the sum and average, and finally outputs the results to the console.
